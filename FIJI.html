                    <p>
                        With its turquoise waters, glittering sands and luxe resorts, Fiji is similar to many other
                        tropical getaways. But Fiji differs from other island destinations in its otherworldliness. Since it's
                        more than 1,300 miles from New Zealand's North Island in the South Pacific Ocean, Fiji affords you
                        the delectable feeling of seclusion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You'll be as far from reality as possible when you're sipping Fiji Bitter beer and watching the
                        sun dip below the horizon. Happiness comes naturally in Fiji. It's in their culture, their family,
                        their warm Bula spirit, their fresh diet, and their stunning nature. Which kind of makes
                        them happiness experts when it comes to creating unforgettable holiday experiences for their guests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fijian customs will make you feel a million miles away: Ever tasted the dizzying kava drink? Or
                        watched men defy fire and walk across scalding stones without burning their feet? If not, it's
                        about time you did.

                    <h3>Visit a village and experience life the Fijian way</h3>
                    <p>
                        Anyone who has ever pulled ashore to a Fijian island resort can testify to being greeted warmly
                        and with welcoming songs, but to really get familiar with this beautiful place, head to a homestay or
                        visit a village. Homestays provide an unmatchable, authentic insight into the real Fiji - you'll be
                        living with a Fijian family, like a Fijian family.
                        <br><br>
                        While you're more likely to catch a meke (lively performance enacting ancient lore) at a resort
                        than avvillage, there's a good chance you'll be treated to a slow-cooked lovo (pit oven) feast. Expect
                        loaded plates of succulent meat and fish, plenty of local root vegetables and palusami (tinned beef 
                        or vegetables and coconut cream wrapped in taro leaves).

                    <h3>Drink kava, Fiji's beverage of choice</h3>

                    <p>
                        From formal events to parties among friends, kava is Fiji's drink of choice. Kava (yagona) is
                        made from pepper root ground into a fine powder and mixed with water. It's typically scooped from a large
                        wooden bowl (tanoa) and served in a coconut shell cup (bilo).
                        <br><br>
                        Each Fijian community has its own etiquette and customs when it comes to drinking kava, and
                        travelers are quickly forgiven for not hitting each cue. When in doubt, you can follow the common kava
                        drinking customs of Fiji's capital city. When a cup is handed to you, clap before taking it with both
                        hands.Drink the liquid in one go if you can, hand it back with both hands, clap again and say “Bula!”

            <h3>Best Month to Visit</h3>
            <p>
                Fiji has two seasons: summer (the wet season) and winter (the dry season). The latter (generally June to
                September) is the peak tourist season in Fiji. May and October are considered Fiji's shoulder months,
                offering that sweet spot of fewer fellow tourists and pleasant weather. The best weather coincides with
                higher prices and bigger crowds in Fiji, but there's never a bad time to visit - not even during cyclone
                season. So, whether you want to lounge on a beach, sail between islands or snorkel with manta rays,
                here's when to go to Fiji.

                            can save you a lot on airfare and accommodations.

                            Although Fiji's official language is English, you will endear yourself to the friendly
                            Fijians by learning a few words of their native Fijian tongue. "Bula" (pronounced mboo-la) is "hello";
                            "vinaka" (pronounced vee-nah-kah) means "thank you"; “kere kere” (kerry kerry) is “please” and "moce"
                            (pronounced mow-they) is "goodbye." If you're staying at a resort and choose to venture into town, dress
                            modestly. When going to a village, avoid wearing a hat, as it will insult the village's chief.

                            There's nothing more Fijian than joining in on the country's favourite pastime: eating.
                            Often reserved for special occasions, a communal lovo is a traditional cooking method where women prepare
                            the food and men tend to the fire and cooking. Meat, fish and root crops like taro are cooked on
                            white-hot stones in an underground pit covered with leaves and dirt to cook slowly for a few hours. The result
                            is a smoky, succulent feast. Many resorts (and villages) include this method of cooking as a weekly
                            activity that includes traditional singing and dancing.

                            In addition to being master navigators and sailors, many Fijians know a thing or two about
                            getting down rivers too. Villagers in the interior of Fiji's larger islands use a raft called a bilibili
                            made of bamboo poles lashed together with traditional rope and steered by a long bamboo pole to
                            carry produce or go fishing. You can ride one down the Navua River near Pacific Harbour with Discover Fiji or
                            learn to make one at the Namosi Eco Retreat in the interior of Viti Levu.
